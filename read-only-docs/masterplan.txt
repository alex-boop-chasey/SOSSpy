CHARGE TIMER PRO — 2025 MASTER PLAN (v2 — FINAL)

We ship exactly 8 viral features, zero backend, one subscription.

Claude Commands (frozen)
• urls → list raw GitHub URLs for every file in the current project (one per line)
• c/p → commit + push current changes to main
• c/p feature → create feature branch → commit → push
• build/run → mcp xcodebuildmcp.build_run_sim --logs (primary build command)

Prototype Strategy — ONLY 3 throw-away apps
1. PriceSpy → DONE
2. SOSSpy → CURRENT (Battery SOS + Apple EV Routing + Tesla fallback)
3. CheapSlotEngine → next (pure library)
→ Then merge into final ChargeTimerPro monorepo

8 Features We Actually Ship
1. Real-time + 48h wholesale prices (free APIs)
2. Battery SOS (low % + far from home)
3. Apple EV Routing + Tesla fallback
4. Calendar sync
5. Public charger scout (OpenChargeMap)
6. Home screen + Widgets + Live Activity + Siri
7. Gamified savings (kWh → coffees + screenshots)
8. Dark-mode-only price-drop local notifications

Tech Stack (non-negotiable)
• Claude Code CLI = coder
• XcodeBuildMCP = builder/tester
• Xcode 26 + Swift 6 + SwiftUI + xcodegen
• VS Code = docs only
• No backend, no Combine, no UIKit, no extra MCP servers

Folder Rules
Core/ = never touches UI
All services = protocol + real + mock
UI/ = only SwiftUI + @Observable ViewModels

Entitlements Day 1
Background fetch | Always Location | EV Routing | App Intents | Live Activities | WidgetKit

Claude Rules (never break)
• When I say “next” → one complete logical step (xcodegen + files + commit)
• All terminal blocks start with `cd`
• Use XcodeBuildMCP aggressively
• Commit style: feat: / fix: / refactor:
• Never split a logical step
• Never overbuild prototypes

Current stage: Building SOSSpy (prototype #2)
