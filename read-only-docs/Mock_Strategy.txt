3. MOCK DATA FILES (REAL FILENAMES — DO NOT RENAME)

    # NO JSON for BatterySOSDetector — it is pure Core/Engine
    # BatterySOSDetector is tested exclusively via unit tests; it has no Real/Mock service implementations.

4. MOCK RULES PER FEATURE … (unchanged)

5. ALLOWED MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS (BOTH VALID) … (unchanged)

6. WHEN MOCKS ARE USED … (unchanged)

7. MOCK VALIDATION RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
------------------------------------------------
Whenever a Real<Domain>Service model is changed:

1. Update the Real service to return the new model shape.
2. Regenerate or update the Mock service to return IDENTICAL model shapes.
3. If JSON is used:
   • Create a minimal JSON sample matching the new model structure
   • Ensure every field in the Real model exists in the mock JSON
   • Remove fields not represented in the model
4. Commit Real + Mock changes together as one atomic commit.

Rules:
• We validate MODEL STRUCTURE, not raw API payloads.
• Mock JSON must remain small, deterministic, and human-edited.
• Hand-editing mocks is allowed ONLY to match model shape — never guess.
